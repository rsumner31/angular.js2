Viewflow takes best parts from two worlds. It is based on BPMN -

django web development toolchain. BPMN provides a standard
notation readily understandable by all business stakeholders. Viewflow
bridging the gap between picture and executable, ready to use web
application.

After over than 10 years history of the BPMN standard, it contains
whole set of battle-proven primitives for all occasions, helps you to
describe all real life business process scenarios. Viewflow helps you
to build a bpmn diagram in code and keep business logic separate from
django forms and views code.
